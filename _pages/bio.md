I apologise if you have not figured out my name already but I am not going to spell it out for you again. What I can tell you is that I am a **physics and mathematics educator** at [Rishi Valley School](https://www.rishivalley.org/), India. I am also a **computational physicist** with a Master of Science in Physics from the [Bonn-Cologne Graduate School of Physics and Astronomy](https://www.gradschool.physics.uni-bonn.de/graduate-school/) at the University of Cologne and a Bachelor of Science (Research) in Physics from [Shiv Nadar University](https://snu.edu.in/departments/department-of-physics/).

I know, I know, now you want the tldr version of my research interests because you are too lazy to check out the other tabs. _Sigh_. Like many of you, I have been fooled by this buzzword called **quantum**, in particular by quantum computing and its foundations. My most recent work, i.e, my master thesis focuses on **quantum** and **quantum-inspired neural networks** on which I worked as a part of the [Quantum Information Group](https://qi.uni-koeln.de/) alongside [Prof. Dr. David Gross](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MQuwOP4AAAAJ&hl=en). Along the way I have also meddled in projects involving **tensor network** methods such as **matrix product states**, **operators** and **density matrix renormalization groups**. I also have extensive experience with **MCMC** (to the Hindi speakers who are giggling, I suggest you get on with googling) methods and **statistical inference**. I also did some work on **quantum gravity** during my bachelors which led me to a ton of rigorous mathematical machinery related to **non-commutative geometries** and **representation theory**. When I am not procrastinting like I am with this website, I contribute to open-source code for associated quantum computing libraries in Python, C++ and Julia while ruminating the early stages of developing my own open source platform on a programming language I have come to admire off late. Wondering what any of this happens to do with teaching at a high school?

You will not get much of an answer here but you will find an answer or therabouts in [this post](/blog/2025/physicsedu). Anyways, I thoroughly enjoy teaching and have derived a lot of enjoyment from tutoring students ranging from the high school to graduate levels. Partly, my digression into physics education is because of the higher gains I have had from it relative to research. A core aim for me in this journey is to develop a balanced resource for high school physics students and educators. Perhaps there is hope for me in physics education research?
