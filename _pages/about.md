### Welcome! You have landed in my yet unfinished website!

Here you will find a scatterbrained blog, some teaching material which may or may not be complete, and an archive of several talks and proceedings of yore. Additionally, you can parse through the work I choose to show you here and their sources among other things. If that does not satisfy you, you can snoop through my résumé as well. Now, enough about what this whole charade is about and more about me.

I apologise if you have not figured out my name already but I am not going to spell it out for you again. What I can tell you is that I am an incumbent physics educator at Rishi Valley School, India. I am also a computational physicist with a Master of Science in Physics from the Bonn-Cologne Graduate School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Cologne and a Bachelor of Science (Research) in Physics from Shiv Nadar University.

I know, I know, now you want the tldr version of my research interests because you are too lazy to check out the other tabs. _Sigh_. Like many of you, I have been fooled by this buzzword called **quantum**, in particular by quantum computing and its foundations. My most recent work, i.e, my master thesis focuses on **quantum** and **quantum-inspired neural networks**. Along the way I have also meddled in projects involving **tensor network** methods such as **matrix product states**, **operators** and **density matrix renormalization groups**. I also have extensive experience with **MCMC** (to the Hindi speakers who are giggling, I suggest you get on with googling) methods and **statistical inference**. I also did some work on **quantum gravity** during my bachelors which led me to a ton of rigorous mathematical machinery related to **non-commutative geometries** and **representation theory**. When I am not procrastinting like I am with this website, I contribute to open-source code for associated quantum computing libraries in Python, C++ and Julia while ruminating the early stages of developing my own open source platform on a programming language I have come to admire off late. Wondering what any of this happens to do with teaching at a high school?

You will not get much of an answer here but I will update this page about it soon. Anyways, I thoroughly enjoy teaching and have derived a lot of enjoyment from tutoring students ranging from the high school to graduate levels. Partly, my digression into physics education is because of the higher gains I have had from it relative to research. A core aim for me in this journey is to develop a balanced resource for high school physics students and educators. Perhaps there is hope for me in physics education research? More on that in the news post linked below. Hopefully you can tell which one.
