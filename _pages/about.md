I'm an incumbent physics educator at Rishi Valley School, India. I am a computational physicist with a Master of Science in Physics from the Bonn-Cologne Graduate School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Cologne and a Bachelor of Science (Research) in Physics from Shiv Nadar University.

My research interests lie in and around this buzzword called **quantum**, in particular with quantum computing and its foundations. My most recent work, i.e, my master thesis focuses on **quantum** and **quantum-inspired neural networks**. I have previously worked with **ZX calculus** as well. I have also meddled in projects with **tensor network** methods such as **matrix product states**, **operators** and **density matrix renormalization groups**. I have extensive experience with extensive **Monte Carlo Markov Chain** analysis and **statistical inference** as well. Currently, I contribute to open-source code for associated quantum computing libraries in Python, C++ and Julia while in the early stages of developing my own open source platform.

Besides research, I thoroughly enjoy teaching and coming up with clean and enjoyable scripts for students to read about different topics from. This is in-part the key motivation behind my excursion into high school physics. During the course, I aim to develop a balanced resource for high school physics students and educators. Perhaps there is hope for me in physics education research?
