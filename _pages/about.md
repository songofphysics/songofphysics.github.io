### Unfortunately, you have landed in my yet unfinished website!

Here you will find a scatterbrained blog, some teaching material which may or may not be complete, and an archive of several talks and proceedings of yore. Additionally, you can parse through the work I choose to show you here and their sources among other things. If that does not satisfy you, you can snoop through my résumé as well. Now, enough about what this whole charade is about and more about me.
