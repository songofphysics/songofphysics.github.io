I'm currently a graduate student pursuing a Master of Science in Physics at the Bonn-Cologne Graduate School of Physics and Astronomy. I am working on my master's thesis in the field of quantum algorithms in continuous variables (CV) in the cluster of excellence ML4Q (Matter and Light for Quantum Computing) and the Institute for Theoreical Physics at the University of Cologne. 

My research interests lie in and around this buzzword called "quantum," in particular with quantum computing (QC) and algorithms. My current work focuses on Quantum and Quantum-Inspired Neural Networks. I have previously worked with ZX calculus as well. I have also done projects with Tensor Network methods such as Matrix Product States and Operators; and Density Matrix Renormalization Groups. I have also worked with extensive Monte Carlo Markov Chain Analysis and Inference; and Agent Based Models such as the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process. 

Besides these, I thoroughly enjoy teaching and coming up with clean and enjoyable scripts for students to read about different topics from. I would also potentially like to dabble in quantum foundations research sometime in the future. Although, the stuff I'd like to dabble in the most is travelling the world and tasting different cuisines. My weeb degenerate energy levels can be found in this [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/).
