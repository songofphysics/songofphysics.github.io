### You've landed on my perpetually unfinished site!

Here you will find a scatterbrained [blog](/blog/), some [teaching material](/teaching/) which may or may not be complete, and an [archive](/publications/) of several talks and proceedings of yore which have yet to be hosted on this site. Additionally, you can parse through the [work](/projects/) I choose to show you here once I re-write them with some pedagogical flair. If that does not satisfy you, you can snoop through my [résumé](/cv/) as well.

If you have had enough of this charade and want to know more about me, feel free to peek in my very human generated [bio](/bio/). The short version is that I am a computational physicist specializing in quantum information and a physics educator to boot. I take no responsibility of the strange things on this site until it is finished. Feel free to reach me via my [email](mailto:sangeets@rishivalley.org).
